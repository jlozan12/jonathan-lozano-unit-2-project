    <h3>Worth Buying?</h3>
    <p>Honestly, it depends if you have the money for it. GO AND BUY ONE!! Not only are they quiet because they are electric, they are also somewhat reliable and totally fun to use. They were made to be used in the dirt, but you can also use them on pavement and almost any surface (excluding water, of course). Personally, if I had the money to get one, I would totally buy the Ultra Bee as it is the middle to best one from the Light Bee and Storm Bee, and I wouldn't need all the power of the Storm Bee. The choice is yours as there are three and each one is designed for different preferences. But, is it worth buying? Yes, it is.</p>

<h4>locations</h4>
      <p> as to what I have seen the only locations I have found near the area of oakand that are known to have are. one in sacramento and one in Los angeles. hyper rides or rocklin
      <a href="https://hyperrides.com/"> (sacramento)</a> and luna cycle.
      <a href="https://lunacycle.com/"> (los angeles) </a>


      
    <h5>The Reason for Writing This</h4>
    <p>The reason I'm writing about this (being the Sur-ron) is because I have wanted one since three years ago, but I haven't been able to because of the price (totally affordable for a kid my age) and I have had a lot of problems collecting the money because I can't get a job due to my age. My plan was to be able to buy the Sur-ron Light Bee (as it is the cheapest one and easiest to acquire) by the end of the year, but I guess not. I really hope that by next year or before, I get to own one and not just look at other people using it.</p>
